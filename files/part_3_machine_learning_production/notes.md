- Deployment

We will use Amazon SageMaker to deploy our models.

Amazon's SageMaker: Prepare -> Build -> Train and Tune -> **Deploy and Manage**

Question that will be answered in this session:

1. What's the machine learning workflow?
Explore and Process -> Modeling -> Deployment

1. How does deployment fit into the machine learning workflow?
Deploying, monitoring and updating throughout the time.

1. What is cloud computing?
Transformantion of IT products into IT services.

1. Why would we use cloud computing for deploying machine learning models?
- Reduced investments and Proportional Costs
- Increased Scalability
- Increased Availability and Reliability

1. Why isn't deployment a part of many machine learning curriculums?
Because this part of the job is normally associated with Ops and not with Analysts or Data Scientists. But currently we have technologies that bring facilities to deployment and Analysts can done the deployment job too.

1. What does it mean for a model to be deployed?
The integration of the model with the production enviroment existent. And use the inputs of the existing enviroment to output predictions using real world data.

1. What are the essential characteristics associated with the code of deployed models?
- Coded into the programming languange of the production environment
- Coded in Predictive Model Markup Language (PMML) or Portable Format Analytics (PFA)
- Python model is converted into a format that can be used in the production environment

1. What are different cloud computing platforms we might use to deploy our machine learning models?
- AWS, GCP or Azure

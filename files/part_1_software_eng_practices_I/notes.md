# Clean and Modular Code

## Production code:
Software running on production servers to handle live users and data of the intended audience. Note this is different from *production quality* code, which describes *code that meets expectations in reliability, efficiency, etc.*, for production. Ideally, all code in production meets these expectations, but this is not always the case.

## Clean:
Readable, simple, consise. A characteristic of production quality code that is crucial for collaboration and maintainabillity in software development
